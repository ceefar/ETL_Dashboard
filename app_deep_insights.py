# rename other page then to like id compare + insights or sumnt

# class based structure here pls with true insights

# quickly try out multithreading while setting up ?!

# can actually do different types of insights too based on the results  
# - i.e. if a week/day/whatever is a performer we can show something different that if it is average or good!
#   - hella want classes for stuff like this tho, i.e. class method for deciding how 'good' it performed, then another for deciding which insight to show 
#     - could be randomised to a degree too say if each had 2 or sumnt idk - maybe even swipe/paginated cards or whatever, lots could be done for sure!










# do portfolio mode really just start it tbf you can come back to it...
# also maybe try multi-threading for like a short time...
# i think this yanno, some tutorials for the day multithreading, multiprocessing, apis, flutter?!, should really do some cpp too 
# then either above or do api/sumnt new (see todo notes) - seriously think do dateors task yanno

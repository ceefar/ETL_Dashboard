THINGS TO ADD
*************
logging
ci/cd 
unittesting


PAGES
*************
store vs store
store insights (more about hours of the day than anything else)
product insights (more about products duh, hours of the day too tho obvs)
days of the week / week breakdown
compare between dates


ACTUAL TODO
*************
insights stuff <<<<<<<<<<<
- much more interesting and explorative so move on to this whenever

between two dates, week, month, all time
- just make all this shit its own page now is just easier

first metric deltas

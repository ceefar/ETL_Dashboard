THINGS TO ADD
*************
logging
ci/cd 
unittesting
base data needs to just be available, like stored in an array or dict or whatever (same format it would get back from a query)
test multithreading and multiprocessing to implement in this but do in an actually test file as yeah is more complicated than just add and done
    - see bookmarks for links


PAGES
*************
store vs store
store insights (more about hours of the day than anything else)
product insights (more about products duh, hours of the day too tho obvs)
days of the week / week breakdown
compare between dates
dashboard home


ACTUAL TODO
*************
insights stuff 
    - do the above bug real quick?
    - actual new insights deep dive
    - portfolio mode
    - artist / calendar print\
    - finish dates tabs
    - get main items from store new table (with stores) asap as this is the most computationally expensive query so far it seems
    - tidy up and comment

# NO CAP, ONCE THIS INSIGHTS IS DONE MOVE ON TO OTHER (QUICKER PROJECTS LIKE 2 IDEAS AM JUST GUNA COPY AND CANCER TING)
# - one was the map idea (best suited area for you, could add in whatever user selects I want tbh but house price and like council tax, average shop sumnt is good start)
# - other was skal.es week time thing

dashboard stuff
    - hate to say it but probably best to rewrite dashboard page now as is just a mess & nothing is working lol
    - plan it, keep it simple, and it will be easy tbf
    - and dont forget to add in portfolio mode stuff

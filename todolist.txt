product insights (more about products duh, hours of the day too tho obvs)
days of the week / week breakdown
compare between dates
dashboard home


ACTUAL TODO
*************
insights stuff 
    - adding in the compare 2 items code now, but must add none functionality (may even be a checkbox/toggle instead of multiselect?)
    - artist
    - cached
    - tidy up and comment
    - portfolio mode
    - actual new insights deep dive


dashboard
    - hate to say it but probably best to rewrite dashboard page now as is just a mess & nothing is working lol
    - plan it, keep it simple, and it will be easy tbf
    - and dont forget to add in portfolio mode stuff

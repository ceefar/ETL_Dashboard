THINGS TO ADD
*************
logging
ci/cd 
unittesting
base data needs to just be available, like stored in an array or dict or whatever (same format it would get back from a query)
test multithreading and multiprocessing to implement in this but do in an actually test file as yeah is more complicated than just add and done
    - see bookmarks for links


PAGES
*************
store vs store
store insights (more about hours of the day than anything else)
product insights (more about products duh, hours of the day too tho obvs)
days of the week / week breakdown
compare between dates
dashboard home


ACTUAL TODO
*************
insights stuff 
    - do the above bug real quick?
    - actual new insights deep dive
    - portfolio mode
    - artist / calendar print\
    - finish dates tabs
    - tidy up and comment

dashboard stuff
    - hate to say it but probably best to rewrite dashboard page now as is just a mess & nothing is working lol
    - plan it, keep it simple, and it will be easy tbf
    - and dont forget to add in portfolio mode stuff
